## Instructions

1. Combine meat, 7:2:1, breadcrumbs, and egg in mixing bowl. Knead with hands until there are no clumps. Separate into multiple patties, and then separate each patty into two half-patties.
    - 3 servings: ~180g/patty, ~90g/half
    - 4 servings: ~135g/patty, ~65g/half
1. Preheat cast iron frying pan to 4.
    - :warning: I don't know if 4 on my stove is the same as 4 on your stove. Mine's electric.
1. Using a burger press or your hands, flatten a half-patty.
1. Place the round cookie cutter in the center of the half-patty. Ask the diner how much cheese they would like. If the diner wants a lot of cheese, fill it to the top. If they want a little cheese, just cover the bottom. If they want no cheese, tell them how wrong they are. Carefully lift the cookie cutter, trying to keep the cheese from spilling to or past the edges of the patty.
1. Take the remaining half-patty and spread it gently until it completely covers the cheese and is the same size as the lower patty. Use the burger press, your fingers, or both to smush the two patty halves into one. Any cracking in the patties or escaping cheese will wind up seeping out in the frying pan.
1. Cook the patties for 5 minutes on each side.
